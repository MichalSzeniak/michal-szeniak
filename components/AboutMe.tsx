                As a passionate Front-End Developer with over two years of
                experience, I have honed my craft in building a diverse array of
                projects. My expertise lies in React technology, where I excel
                in writing high-quality, straightforward code to solve complex
                challenges. I am on the lookout for opportunities that will
                allow me to leverage my skills and experience to develop
                innovative and user-centric web applications.

                Currently, I am a key member of the development team at Ultimate
                Systems in Krak√≥w, where I have been contributing since August
                2021. My role involves developing multiple applications using
                React, and my ability to code independently has been
                instrumental in implementing a CRM system, a cancer treatment
                website, e-learning platform, and task management solutions.
