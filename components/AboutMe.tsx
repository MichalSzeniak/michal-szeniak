              As a passionate Front-End Developer with over two years of
              experience, I have honed my craft in building a diverse array of
              projects. My expertise lies in React technology, where I excel in
              writing high-quality, straightforward code to solve complex
              challenges. I am on the lookout for opportunities that will allow
              me to leverage my skills and experience to develop innovative and
              user-centric web applications.

              Currently, I am a key member of the development team at Ultimate
              Systems in Krak√≥w, where I have been contributing since August
              2021. My role involves developing multiple applications using
              React, and my ability to code independently has been instrumental
              in implementing a CRM system, a cancer treatment website,
              e-learning platform, and task management solutions.
